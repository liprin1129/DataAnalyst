## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Import ggplot2 library
```{r}
library(ggplot2) #must load the ggplot package first
data(diamonds) #loads the diamonds data set since it comes with the ggplot package
```

# 1. Quiz: Prive vs x.
```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = x, y = price), data = diamonds) +
  geom_point()
```

# 2. Correlation
```{r}
# correlation between price and x
with(diamonds, cor.test(x, price, method = 'pearson'))

# correlation between price and y
cor(diamonds$price, diamonds$y, method = 'pearson')

# correlation between price and z
with(diamonds, cor.test(price, z, method = 'pearson'))
```

# 3. Price vs. Depth
```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = depth, y = price), data = diamonds) +
  geom_point()
```

# Adjustment: Price vs. Depth
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = depth, y = price)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/100) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(50, 70), breaks = seq(50, 70, 2))
```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Import ggplot2 library
```{r}
library(ggplot2) #must load the ggplot package first
data(diamonds) #loads the diamonds data set since it comes with the ggplot package
```

# 1. Quiz: Prive vs x.
```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = x, y = price), data = diamonds) +
  geom_point()
```

# 2. Correlation
```{r}
# correlation between price and x
with(diamonds, cor.test(x, price, method = 'pearson'))

# correlation between price and y
cor(diamonds$price, diamonds$y, method = 'pearson')

# correlation between price and z
with(diamonds, cor.test(price, z, method = 'pearson'))
```

# 3. Price vs. Depth
```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = depth, y = price), data = diamonds) +
  geom_point()
```

# 5. Adjustment: Price vs. Depth
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = depth, y = price)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/100) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(50, 70), breaks = seq(50, 70, 2))
```

# 7. Correlatoin between price and depth
```{r}
with(diamonds, cor.test(price, depth, method = "pearson") )
```

# 8. Price vs. Carat
Create a scatterplot of price vs carat
and omit the top 1% of price and carat
values.
```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price), data = subset(diamonds, price < quantile(price, probs = .99) & 
                                                  carat < quantile(carat, probs = .99))) +
  geom_point()
```

# 9. Price vs. Volume
Create a scatterplot of price vs. volume (x * y * z).
This is a very rough approximation for a diamond's volume.

Create a new variable for volume in the diamonds data frame.
This will be useful in a later exercise.

Don't make any adjustments to the plot just yet.
```{r}
diamonds$volume <- diamonds$x * diamonds$y * diamonds$z
ggplot(aes(x = volume, y = price), data = diamonds) +
  geom_point()
```

Did you notice some outliers? Some volumes are 0! There's an expensive diamond with a volume near 4000, and a cheaper diamond with a volume near 900.


You can find out how many diamonds have 0 volume by using count(diamonds$volume == 0). The count() function comes with the plyr package.


Note: If you ran the count function from plyr, you need to run this command in R to unload the plyr package.
detach("package:plyr", unload=TRUE)
The plyr package will conflict with the dplyr package in later exercises.


Depending on your investigation, it may or may not be important for you to understand how outliers, like these, came to be in your data.

# 11. Corellation and coeficient
Correlation between price and volume

```{r}
with(subset(diamonds, volume != 0 & volume < 800), cor.test(price, volume, method = "pearson"))
```

# 12. Adjustments - price vs. volume
Subset the data to exclude diamonds with a volume
greater than or equal to 800. Also, exclude diamonds
with a volume of 0. Adjust the transparency of the
points and add a linear model to the plot. (See the
Instructor Notes or look up the documentation of
geom_smooth() for more details about smoothers.)

We encourage you to think about this next question and
to post your thoughts in the discussion section.

Do you think this would be a useful model to estimate
the price of diamonds? Why or why not?

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = volume, y = price), data = subset(diamonds, volume > 0 & volume < 800)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
# 13. Mean Price by Clarity
Use the function dplyr package
to create a new data frame containing
info on diamonds by clarity.

Name the data frame diamondsByClarity

The data frame should contain the following
variables in this order.

     (1) mean_price
     (2) median_price
     (3) min_price
     (4) max_price
     (5) n

where n is the number of diamonds in each
level of clarity.

```{r}
clarity_group <- group_by(diamonds, clarity)
diamondsByClarity <- summarise(clarity_group,
                                        mean_price = mean(price),
                                        median_price = median(price),
                                        min_price = min(price),
                                        max_price = max(price),
                                        n = n())
diamondsByClarity <- arrange(diamondsByClarity, clarity)
```
```{r Alterative code using dplyr}
library('dplyr')

diamondsByClarity <- 
  diamonds %>%
  group_by(clarity) %>%
  summarise(mean_price = mean(price),
            median_price = median(price),
            min_price = min(price),
            max_price = max(price),
            n = n()) %>%
  arrange(clarity)
```

# 14. Bar Charts of Mean Price

Weâ€™ve created summary data frames with the mean price
by clarity and color. You can run the code in R to
verify what data is in the variables diamonds_mp_by_clarity
and diamonds_mp_by_color.

Your task is to write additional code to create two bar plots
on one output image using the grid.arrange() function from the package
gridExtra.

This assignment is not graded and
will be marked as correct when you submit.

See the Instructor Notes for more info on bar charts
and for a hint on this task.

# DO NOT DELETE THE LINES OF CODE BELOW
# ===================================================================
```{r}
diamonds_by_clarity <- group_by(diamonds, clarity)
diamonds_mp_by_clarity <- summarise(diamonds_by_clarity, mean_price = mean(price))

diamonds_by_color <- group_by(diamonds, color)
diamonds_mp_by_color <- summarise(diamonds_by_color, mean_price = mean(price))
```

Bar Charts vs. Histograms (http://flowingdata.com/2014/02/27/how-to-read-histograms-and-use-them-in-r/)

Hint: Save each plot into a variable and pass the two variables to grid.arrange(). Be sure you have installed and loaded the gridExtra package.

```{r Bar plot using geom_bar()}
p1 = ggplot(aes(x = clarity, y = mean_price), data = diamonds_mp_by_clarity) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
p2 = ggplot(aes(x = color, y = mean_price), data = diamonds_mp_by_color) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")

library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```


```{r Alternative bar plot using geom_col}
p1 = ggplot(aes(x = clarity, y = mean_price), data = diamonds_mp_by_clarity) +
  geom_col()
p2 = ggplot(aes(x = color, y = mean_price), data = diamonds_mp_by_color) +
  geom_col()

library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```
